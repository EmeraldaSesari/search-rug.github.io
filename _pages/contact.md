We are located in the [Bernoulliborg building (5161)](https://www.rug.nl/staff/location/5161) on the university's Zernikecomplex campus. 

## Car park

The parking areas P1 and P4 are closest to Nijenborgh 9 (Bernoulliborg). P1 is located on the south side of the Zernike complex and P4 above the Willem Alexander Sports Center. Both are only accessible with a parking ticket for employees, for visitors of employees and for the disabled. If you wish to park here as a guest of a University of Groningen staff member, it is desirable that the relevant staff member reports this to the Building Management. If as a visitor you are not registered in advance there is a risk that there is no space. Please see the <a href="https://www.rug.nl/staff/location/zernike-plattegrond" target="_blank">map of the Zernike Campus</a> for an overview of all parking spaces.

## Disabled people

There are three public parking spaces for the disabled near the main entrance of the building. These are freely accessible and reservation is not required. The building is accessible for wheelchair users, excluding the Blaauw Observatory, and has elevators and special toilet facilities.

## Cycling routes

Cycling to and from the Zernike campus? Use the smart routes without traffic lights to save time! See: <a href="https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/practical-matters/slimme-route" target="_blank">Smart cycling routes</a>
