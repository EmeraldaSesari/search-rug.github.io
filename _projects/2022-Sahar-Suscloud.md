short: "he ever increasing digitalization of our world exacerbated the need (and opportunity) to 
address global sustainability goals at software level. In fact, architecting sustainable softwareintensive systems, or systems for short, is recognized as one of the grand challenges of 
contemporary software engineering. The ubiquity of such systems provides a unique
opportunity for a singular point of intervention in ameliorating sustainability across the sociotechnical spectrum. At the same time, it also generates the necessary urgency in delivering 
sustainability through appropriate architecting practices. These practices are particularly 
compelling because they allow to reason and evaluate system sustainability throughout the 
system's lifecycle. The wide adoption of cloud computing, however, where software, platforms, 
and infrastructure are delivered as-a-service makes this task complicated due to the opaqueness 
of consumed services. Related work on the topic so far has focused mainly on minimizing energy 
consumption at data center level, i.e. on the environmental dimension, at the expense of the 
other sustainability dimensions, that is the technical, economic, and social ones. To address this 
deficiency, this project aims to develop a sustainability-aware architecting framework
specifically for cloud-based software services which incorporates all dimensions of system 
sustainability. The framework is structured around the use of sustainability indicators, one per 
dimension, as the means of abstracting away from dimension-specific concerns. A major 
component of this project is the definition and evaluation of appropriate metrics associated 
with each indicator. Beyond that, our position, which we aim to test through this project, is that 
improving the indicator for each of the sustainability dimensions creates a positive 
reinforcement effect on the other indicators. We aim to investigate the efficacy of this 
(pro)position through a combination of empirical software engineering and design science. In 
order to achieve this goal, we will also create solid architecting tools, methods, and guidelines 
for delivering sustainability-aware cloud-based software services. By these means,
SustainableCloud will actively contribute to developing a sustainability-aware future cloud"
