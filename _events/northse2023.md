Connecting Research and Practice of Software Engineering in the North Netherlands 

# About

The **North SE workshop** serves as a platform for both software engineering researchers and industry professionals to delve into theoretical and applied elements, tackle technical hurdles, and identify potential collaborative ventures. 

In the current edition, the workshop coincides with a Ph.D. defense (details here), capitalizing on the attendance of distinguished software engineering experts and practitioners hailing from the Netherlands, Portugal, and the United States.

## Abstracts

> **Gender, emotions and software development**\
>  &nbsp;&nbsp; by Alexander Serebrenik
>
> As software development is a human activity, it is essential for us to understand how different individuals experience it, and how do they work together. In this talk we illustrate  these two complementary perspectives by discussing experiences of women in software development, on the one hand, and emotions expressed in developers’ teams, on the other. The studies call for providing better tools and more inclusive processes ensuring that individual talents can jointly lead to better software.

> **Biography**: Alexander Serebrenik is a full professor of social software engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands. His research goal is to facilitate evolution of software by taking into account social aspects of software development. His work tends to involve theories and methods both from within computer science (e.g., theory of socio-technical coordination; methods from natural language processing, machine learning) and from outside of computer science (e.g., organisational psychology). The underlying idea of his work is that of empiricism, i.e., that addressing software engineering challenges should be grounded in observation and experimentation, and requires a combination of the social and the technical perspectives. Alexander has co-authored two books “Evolving Software Systems” (Springer Verlag, 2014) and "Equity, Diversity and Inclusion in Software Engineering"(APress, 2023), and more than 240 scientific papers and articles. He is actively involved in organisation of scientific conferences and is member of the editorial board of several journals. He has won multiple best paper and distinguished reviewer awards. Alexander is a senior member of IEEE and a member of ACM. Contact him at a.serebrenik@tue.nl.
