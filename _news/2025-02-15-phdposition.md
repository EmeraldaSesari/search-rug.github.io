Project description
-------------------

The PhD position will be part of an ITEA project entitled VISDOM that deals with analysis and visualization of DevOps. The aim of the project is to provide simple “health check” visualizations about the state of the development process, software and use. 

Our group will focus specifically on developing methods and tools to measure and visualize quality of software (particularly technical debt). We will look into artefacts that are linked to source code but also the running system: issue tracking, log files, project management data, performance traces, ecosystem dependencies, etc. Using such data, our goal is to provide high-level and focused visualizations that would allow the development teams to improve their development process and the quality of their code (e.g. opportunities for refactoring or other forms of technical debt remediation). 

About the host organization
