Project description
-------------------

The 2 full-time PhD positions will be part of an ITEA project entitled
MAST - Managing Sustainability Tradeoffs. The group at the university of
Groningen has teamed up with a European consortium to strengthen the way
in which sustainability can be brought to software-intensive products
and services in a technically viable way. The aim of the project is to
deal with the complex trade-offs between two aspects of sustainability:
technical sustainability (esp. technical debt) and environmental
sustainability (esp. carbon footprint).
The group will build on existing research in order to generate new
innovations and technology (tools to measure and report sustainability,
as well as optimize it) to the benefit of industry partners, as well as
make some of them available as Open Source components for the wider
high-tech and software industry.

The PhD candidates will join the Software Engineering group
([https://search-rug.github.io/](https://search-rug.github.io/)) and will work under the supervision of
Prof. Paris Avgeriou and Prof. Vasilios Andrikopoulos.
