title: Identify discussions on a topic
types:
- BSc
---

People discuss on platforms like X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Reddit, DevRant, Glassdoor, etc. These discussions are valuable sources of information on the concurrent problems and their prospective solutions. 

This project focuses on identifying fairness issues experienced by software developers at work. Each bachelor thesis will pick a platform to identify fairness issues software developers discuss and their prospective solutions, if any. 

At the end of this project, the student is expected to develop programming skills and a working knowledge of natural language processing, information retrieval, and application of large language models such as ChatGPT.
