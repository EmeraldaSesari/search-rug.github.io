This project aims to design and validate methods to infer developer demographics, such as gender, experience levels, geographic distribution, and collaboration patterns, from development activity data. The ultimate goal is to uncover insights that can support equitable and inclusive software development practices.

This project is in collaboration with [Prof. Mei Nagappan](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~m2nagapp/) from the University of Waterloo.
